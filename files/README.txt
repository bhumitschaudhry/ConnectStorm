File-Storm Test Files Directory
================================

This directory contains sample files for the Selenium producer to upload.

Files in this directory:
- sample1.txt: Text file with system description
- sample2.txt: Text file with feature list
- data.json: JSON data file
- README.txt: This file

The Selenium producer will randomly select files from this directory
and upload them to the Flask application, simulating real user behavior.

You can add more files to this directory:
- Images (.png, .jpg, .gif)
- Documents (.pdf, .docx, .txt)
- Data files (.csv, .json, .xml)
- Archives (.zip)

Note: Keep files reasonably sized for free tier deployment.
